# Data Source

https://interviewapi3.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/vehicles/vehicles-index

There are only 2 vehicles detail endpoints stubbed out

# Testing
There should be at least some high level test coverage of the basic functionalities of the app which demonstrate your ability to test your code

# Bonus points
For anything that you think would make your demo stand out, i.e. non-traditional navigation methods, cool presentation / animation styles
