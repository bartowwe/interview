# Mobile Take Home Exercise

Create a rental shopping app using Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android

The app should have the following functionality:
* Finding a car
  * Based on an address, pickup date, and drop-off date return a list of rentals.  This list should be sortable by company, distance, and price (ascending and descending order)
* Upon user selection provide rental details
* Directions to pickup the rental
  *  There should be a call to action showing user's the nearest pickup location and directions on how to get there.
* Make the app look as appealing as possible to use

# Data Source
You should be able to source rental data from the amadeus API:
https://sandbox.amadeus.com/

Using the key provided in the project email

# Testing
There should be at least some high level test coverage of the basic functionalities of the app which demonstrate your ability to test your code

# Bonus points
For anything that you think would make your demo stand out, i.e. non-traditional navigation methods, cool presentation / animation styles
